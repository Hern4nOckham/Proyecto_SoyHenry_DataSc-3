gK9CdFaCXmHoW8aLfXiSqg,Tired Hands Fermentaria,"Restaurants, Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Breweries, Mexican",5.0,"It is quite actually my favorite restaurant in the world; I live in NY and I travel to Admore, PA regularly just to get Fermentaria.  The beer is the best I've ever had, and the food is always a deliciously creative twist on a classic dish.  Despite constantly changing both the beer and food menus, Tired Hands Fermentaria hits the mark Every. Single. Time.  
Overall: 4.97 / Food: 4.8 / Drink: 5.0 / Service: 4.2 / Space: 5.0 / Value: 4.5

Normally I write reviews about the individual dishes I get, but you literally cannot go wrong here.  Instead, I will recommend everything to you and allow you to choose what you're in the mood for.  

Beer: The beer menu changes weekly. So if you haven't visited in a while, it's time to go back. The Tired Hands brewery concocts the most flavorful, palatable, and creative beers I have ever come across.  Anytime they have a MILKSHAKE IPA available on the menu -- make sure you order it.  I do recommend getting 4oz. glasses of several different beers because you should never leave Fermentaria without trying at least 2 beers (and you can always double down with an 8oz of your favorite).  Their menu gives in-depth explanations of the type of beer, the ingredients, and notes that you should be able to taste.  The flavors are usually just as weird as the names (I've seen  ""hint of gummy bears"" as a note and ""We Are All Infinite Energy Vibrating at the Same Frequency"" as a name), but there will be several beers you want to try at any given time.  

Food: While the beer is a show-stopper, you should still want to come to Fermentaria just for the food too.  The BURGER and the TACOS are staples, and are delicious (friendly hint to order chipotle mayo with fries).  The burger/fries, in particular, always finds a way to complement the beer perfectly.  But I've had their rotating specials of FRIED CHICKEN with applebutter, pumpkin waffle, and BBQ BRISKET  -- and everything is always next level phenomenal.  I do miss the fried chicken with applebutter as a staple menu item though.  

The space is amazing, as you sit in spacious, hipster-chic brewery, surrounded by brewing tanks of beer.  For all of its glory, it is relatively cheap -- though a lot of 4oz glasses of beer can add up.

My biases: I'm a mid-20s male from NYC with a mean sweet tooth, a love of large portions, and an appreciation for high-quality food experiences - but only at a value.  Food taste is always the priority.",4,2,2,2020-02-13,eg2Kf_5G8NJiJsIPHdlCWw,Ardmore,MO,40.0066759391,-75.2903721129,35 Cricket Ter,Positivo

The waitstaff accommodated us right away and we tried several dishes: 

Crabby dip- rich and cheesy - supposed to have crab and spinach but I couldn't taste crab...don't get me wrong, the dip is still very tasty and is made for sharing, just don't really count as a crab dip if you don't see any crab in it IMO

Steamed red gulf shrimps -- perfectly steamed-- still nice and juicy, shell-on, I despise overcooked, rubbery shrimp and this ain't it. The broth is light and just simply letting the shrimp shine- must try

Bairdi Snow crab (~$40 Today's MKT for 1.5lbs) (""locally sourced"") - sweet meat, not overcooked. 

Other guests also ordered grilled and blackened grouper which they seem to enjoy

Killer Key Lime pie-- smooth, custard like texture- on the tart side which I enjoy, the crust is rich and buttery--Ann Arbor's Zingermann's is hands down a better pie but this place apparently won best key lime pie 3 yrs in a row here so you must pay respect and get the pie! 

Sweet, awesome waitstaff

I LOVE Izzo's. I've been going since I moved here two years ago. The food tastes great and the service is normally great too. However there is one problem I consistently have and it's driving me crazy. TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES HOW TO PROPERLY ROLL A FREAKING BURRITO. PLEASE.

Tqt99-TsbRT4bmsXHyA1lA,Rostizado - by Tres Carnales,"Restaurants, Mexican",4.0,"So I am not reviewing the restaurant itself. I have been there a few times and the food is excellent. If you like roasted meat it is an amazing place. I remember they also did delicious roasted cauliflower and broccoli.  What I don't like, is that there is no reservations and it is often a really long wait. With it being next to the Ice District, and parking a pain, we just haven't bothered because you also are not sure when you will be seated and you might miss your game, play, or Winspear concert.  I might try going there once they reopen for lunch and see if that is a little easier. 
What I am reviewing is that they catered for Lunchbox shorts during Downtown Dining week. For 15 dollars you got a burrito of your choice (vegan, chicken, steak or pork) and an hour of short films that were related to food. I war really impressed. My steak burrito was delicious and very generous in both steak and flavour. I could have used a bit more heat, but I digress. I also was pretty easy to eat. It was wrapped perfectly and there ended up being no sauce dripping down my  hand.

-Chicken burrito was pretty mediocre, the chicken was very dry. I will say, I don't like sour cream but if you do, that would help make it better. Needs a lot of their sauce to make it tasty.

The food is great, but I'm giving this review 3 stars, because it's not ""Mexican food"". You wouldn't find a menu like this in an authentic Mexican restaurant. 

As a Mexican American, I was thrown off when I saw their menu. There weren't any authentic Mexican dishes on the menu at all. When I ordered horchata (a Mexican rice drink) I was informed that they didn't have any prepared as it isn't a popular item on the menu. The cook needed to make a batch for me. I was mind boggled as I've NEVER heard this in a Mexican restaurant before. TEX-MEX yes, but not Mexican. 

The food was seasoned well, but again, was seasoned like Tex-Mex and didn't have any Mexican flavor. The horchata was HORRIBLE! So much so, after it sat for 5 minutes you'd see the layer of syrup at the bottom of the glass, GROSS! I can see why people don't order it. When I told my family about the restaurant (and they're from Mexico), their reaction was ""what the he*l kind of restaurant was that?!?""

It was my first time there so I was unsure of what I actually wanted or what topping to get. And he told me he was new as well, I think it was his first week. He was just so kind, patient and polite. I was the only customer in there so he took his time to ensure he gave me the best product and didn't make me feel rushed. He explained the MANY different options and gave me his opinion on what he liked so I'd try it (he was right). So after I paid he asked if I was staying, I said yes and I wanted to sit by the window, he literally brought my tray out to me. I took my time eating but by the time I finished there were more customers there, so I quickly walked back there and told him thanks for his kindness again. 
It was so refreshing to have someone be so kind and patient, especially when there was no tip involved (fast food). You could literally tell he was being genuine and was grateful just to be working there. It was awesome. 
I will come back here from now on just because of the amazing customer service I received here. I didn't get his name but I'm sure you'll know who I'm talking about when you visit the restaurant.

Unfortunately there was a grouchy female manager who walked in to the restroom and announced that she would be closing a tab for my myself, a friend, and my dad shortly after our meal began. My friend and I went to the bathroom on the second floor near our table. I have anxiety about touching public surfaces, especially since the start of COVID as I am immune compromised. My friend opens, closes, locks, and touches surfaces for me to help ease the anxiety when situations arise. As I began using the restroom, the manager knocked and informed myself and our guests that our tab would be closed. I said that is absolutely understandable and we would be happy to leave if it would make her more comfortable . She kept repeating that she would close the tab, which l told her was completely fine, as my guests and I just yearned for the experience of the restaurant since it opened only 3 days ago, and atmosphere more than anything, including the drinks. I really enjoyed this restaurant. The line was short for the bar, and we got in on a Saturday within 15 minutes. It was only a 30 minute wait for the restaurant, and they texted us when they were ready. I just wish management wouldn't have been so aggressive to us for using the same stall since other guests were occupying the other one, and been more understanding to mental health concerns, especially during this day in age. It seemed like it bothered her more that were using a restroom quickly one after the other than two full paying, tipping customers. Apparently for the bridal party that was ok, but not for us.

Other then that, I recommended going, just don't bother using a bathroom stall with a friend. Also--don't forget to stop on the way out to the gift shop for a cute tee!",0,1,1,2021-05-22,FRGw2cR3x1lVZ5en_rCzGA,Nashville,FL,36.1616232515,-86.7765881933,308 Broadway,Positivo

LkskzKzo_S8YmG1dGn4hag,Tijuana Flats,"Tex-Mex, Mexican, Restaurants",4.0,"Not my favorite place, but a solid choice for the family.

My husband likes Tijuana Flats. I am not a huge Mexican/Tex-Mex fan, so it isn't my number one go to. However, we had a coupon so we decided to check it out.

I do really like the decor of these places. It's bold and fun. 

My husband got a Megajuana + Wet Burrito. It was supposed to come out smothered in queso, but they forgot. It wasn't a huge deal, since they just brought out queso in a cup. We got a Beef Quesadilla for my son. It was huge! It looks like a normal size quesadilla to me, but for a fraction of the price. I'm glad we planned for me to share that quesadilla, because there is no way my 15 month old was going to eat that. 

The actual food is just ok to me. I found the burrito kind of dry and the quesadilla was standard, nothing special. I asked my husband what he thought of the burrito and he was a huge fan. It really does show you that everyone has different tastes. 

Portion sizes are large and that is reflected in the calorie count. The calories are on the menu, which is great if you are watching your waistline, but terrible if you are watching your waistline and eating here. Just figure nothing is low calorie.

Service here is phenomenal. They actually come around and ask if everything is ok. I felt like the chips didn't have enough seasoning and they actually brought me out a side of the salt mix! I was debating going up to say something, but they made that decision for me by coming to me! It was much appreciated. 

It weirds me out that there are no garbage cans. I like to clean up after myself. I'm glad they mentioned this at the Yelp Event or else I would have spent so much time searching for the garbage!

We had one speed bump-- finding the location-- other than that, the service, the food, and the drinks were all great! We had ordered quite a bit of food to sample a little bit of everything. 

We started with the ""build your own""charcuterie board and opted in for the fresh mozzarella, triple creme Brie, the duck prosciutto, and the aged seranno ham. DO NOT SKIP THE DUCK PROSCIUTTO!! This was probably the best thing we had during our tasting adventure. It's Smokey, salty, and delicate. Just a wonderful bite of food!

We also ordered the short rib tacos (I could've eaten 100 of these), the cheddar fondue with pretzels (great and surprisingly filling), and the chicken yakitori skewers ( delicious). And although I could've kept ordering more shareables, we decided to switch gears and order dessert. We picked 3 items that sounded intriguing and went with the butterscotch panna cotta, tropical tiramisu, and the key lime cheesecake bites. The cheesecake bites offered a well balanced sweet and tart punch to the tongue, while the panna cotta was light and delicate. Both were little bites of heaven. I would probably pass on the tropical tiramisu next go around. It was too sour and I almost felt like I was having another cocktail for dessert with the amount of alcohol in the treat itself. It wasn't terrible, just not my thing. 

Overall, we look forward to having future date nights here and having more of that awesome duck prosciutto!",0,0,0,2020-02-22,RESWa55a4VoDxqdFsPl0zg,Reno,PA,39.445495,-119.745703,1445 S Meadows Pkwy,Positivo

Very attractive looking interior, you order at the counter and there is seating indoors and outside. Seems like things like the guacamole, beans, and rice are ready to go but they cook your selections upon order.  (For what we ordered, we probably waited about 10 minutes which was fine with us).  They also have a ""salsa bar"" with five different selections ranging from mild to hot, as well as a bowl of corn salsa and a bowl of sliced fresh jalapenos.  

I ordered the pork flautas (comes with rice and beans) and chips and queso and my dining companion ordered a torta, black beans and some guacamole and chips. SO MUCH FOOD.  Everything we had was delicious and a bunch of it came back home with us.  She said the guacamole was the best she ever had.

The guy taking the orders at the counter was very patient with us and I heard him talking to another customer (trying to decide what to get) and he was asking ""how hungry are you"" because you can definitely order too much (like we did).

w0eMUGG8nLtQBSnCbURbZQ,Rincon Guatemalteco,"Latin American, Restaurants, Mexican",5.0,"We had a great meal at this small, family owned and run restaurant. The food here is my favorite from all of the Central American restaurants we've tried in the area. The menu is small but they do offer a variety of meat dishes to choose from including fish, chicken, beef and pork. 

We tried the tipico breakfast which includes eggs cooked your way, carne asada (grilled beef), plantains, refried beans and the most delicious tortillas. When I visited Guatemala many years ago I couldn't get enough of their tortillas and coffee. I thought Guatemalan tortillas were the better ones when compared to other Central American countries' tortillas and as I ate them at this restaurant I was quickly reminded of why I loved them so much. They're thicker than the usual tortillas most people know (think more similar to the ones you get with pupusas rather than what you'd get for tacos for example), they are soft, doughy and served hot, the perfect vessel to scoop up your food off the plate. The plantains were cut thinner which allowed for a nice crispiness when fried. The refried beans were also a winner, so thick and flavorful. We also tried the carne adobada which is grilled marinated pork served with rice and refried beans. The pork was tender and flavorful. This dish was also served with two delicious tortillas.

To drink we got the tamarindo drink which was slightly sweet and so refreshing, as well as the atol de elote, a thick warm drink made out of sweet corn which to me was more like a delicious thick liquid dessert than a drink (they even bring you a spoon with it). Lastly we got a sweet bread with sesame seeds to go. The bread, baked in house by the owner of the restaurant, was a soft bun like bread, not overtly sweet and not very doughy. It was a bit firmer and more crumbly than I expected. 

The restaurant has a small store on one side where they sell a very limited number of grocery food items, they also sell a few Guatemalan souvenirs and provide money and shipping services to some Central American countries. Service was very attentive and friendly. The two young people (the girl was the owner's daughter) working the counter, taking our order and serving us were so helpful and answered all of our questions about the food.

  Taco bowl was with Chorizo as the meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and extra sour cream. Same as the nachos just beef. Oh and I passed on the beans and guacamole.

But...when I arrived at my designated time for pick up and called the number given, a fax machine (I think...long high squeal upon pick up) answered the number for a full five minutes.

Reno Pink Taco Truck has popped up in Sparks on Visita and Wingfield Hills Road near the United Federal Credit Union or across the street from Starbucks!
The food is fresh and made to order! My daughter loves the freshly homemade pink tortillas. Those and the pink crema were such a fun touch to the meal. 

The meat is tasty, juicy, and bursting with flavors. 
We tried the chicken tacos, the quesabirria tacos, and the Mexican Asada pizza. Every one of the dishes had its own savory flavor. The tortillas are homemade daily!

I can't place the chicken flavor, but boy, was it delicious! I wanted to go back for more. This could be bad for me as I live on the opposite corner of where they have popped up! 

The quesabirria tacos are made with chopped-up birria stew meat served with onions, cilantro, and a consommé, all in a cheesy pink shell. They are were rich and flavorful. The image of these tacos with the tender, juicy meat and fried, crispy cheese sticking out the top, being dunked into a deep red consommé, warms my tummy up! They also serve this delicious meat as Birria Ramen. They do the beef birria stew meat topped with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice all over noodles! I can't wait to try this! 

My daughter enjoyed the Mexican Asada pizza and chicken tacos. She is tickled pink to see the pink taco shells and the pink crema! My daughter also requested more of the Mexican wedding cookies they gave us as a treat. These buttery cookies feature ingredients like butter, sugar, spices, and nuts. They are oh so delicious! We have requested an order for three dozen already. We hope our friends enjoy them as much as we did. 

The customer service was fantastic. We spoke about the history of the business and the owners behind the delicious creations. Thank you for the conversation and delicious food! Give them a try, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I hope the Reno Pink Taco Truck will continue to stay in the Sparks area as we lack restaurants in the area....plus, they are so yummy.i

Well having checked out Mercy's the answer is yes, because they are very different. While Amici's is more savory and bready, Mercy's are confections. turn overs, cakes, pastries. This is the place to go for a sweet treat, a special breakfast or that great dessert.

I tried the banana turn over and while it seemed a little light on the fruit the pastry was light with a wonderfully subtle flavor.

I took a point off for the appearance. It has seating inside but the look has sort of a 1950's cafeteria vibe.  and if you're sitting at the table inside you'll be a little crowded by anyone paying or looking at the wares.

Upon ordering and pick up the interaction with staff was pleasant and friendly, which is always nice especially these days. My boyfriend and I ordered a whole chicken dinner which included two sides, we chose steamed vegetables, and stir-fried rice. The chicken was amazing. Ive had my fair share of Peruvian chicken and the is right up there with the best. Tender, juicy, flavors on point, ya know all the good stuff. Now the vegetables were good it was a mix of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. Its hard to really mess that up but they were good even had a little smokey finish to them. The rice on the other hand I wasn't really feelin', don't get me wrong the flavors were good, but the rice was a little under cooked in my opinion. My boyfriend however loved the rice so I was in that boat by myself lol. We also ordered ribs which were fall off the bone fabulous (the sauce it came with was pretty spicy and I think I handle spicy pretty well, so I would taste before I slather). That came with some pretty great roasted potatoes and a fava bean salad which for me was just kinda...there... I mean it came in a condiment container so it seamed like more of a garnish or after thought. And im going to finish with what I should have started with, the house guacamole. I WAS OBSESSED, I don't mean to yell but here we are. I already love guacamole and I love my guac on the citrus-y side so this was everything to me. It came with none other those nicely salted freshly fried tortilla chips I always love whenever I order at a nice spot serving Latin fare.

The chips are warm and crispy. The salsa is perfectly flavored. I got a side of the spicy salsa. Beware, it'll take you breath away but I like to mix spicy  with regular  for the added kick. 

I also had margaritas which are petty much perfect anywhere. 

The staff are extremely friendly. I couldn't have asked for better service, better food or better margs.",0,0,0,2020-11-04,rC7kmA175auKVKaINha6rA,Nashville,TN,36.1773377,-86.7459,1313 Woodland St,Positivo

Though I'm going to miss free pizza only steps away, Nick's Cafe is off to a great start in satisfying my workday cravings. Open at 7am until 3pm, food is made to order and so far seems to be plentiful for the price.

At the end of our first week, my officemate & I finally decided to check out Nick's Cafe. The building is undergoing interior renovations, so we have to take the elevator to another floor for restrooms anyway, and we took that opportunity to pick up lunch on Friday. Since it was around 2pm, I skipped coffee, though I was delighted to see their flavorful coffee offerings. Their food menu isn't huge, but lots of items caught my eye so I'm excited to try other things in the future. And if I can get to work before 11am, their breakfast looks like a great deal at $4! 

My order on this first visit was their Cuban sandwich, because I was enticed by the inclusion of all three meats (pork, ham & salami). Though my sandwich was pressed, the bread was ciabatta, and I'm pretty sure the cheese was white American & not Swiss. Plus the pickle was a lengthwise wedge as a side item, like Any Deli, USA. All that aside, this was a very large tasty sandwich and I'll definitely order it again. But probably earlier in the week because I could only get through half and the other half is still uneaten in my home fridge. My sandwich also came with a bag of chips.

The couple working behind the counter was super friendly and also moving fast to fulfill orders (not sure if they're a COUPLE) so the line moved quickly and our wait was pleasant. They recognized that my officemate & I were new tennants immediately which was kinda creepy but also very cool. Obviously they have a semi-captive customer base but in this era of food delivery it's also obvious they're keeping the bar high with fresh food and great service. And even though I'm usually one to bring leftovers or eat a protein bar for lunch, I'm sure I'll be visiting Nick's Cafe often.",20,8,18,2021-03-14,lUO6ba9f952pc-wlIpnpVA,Clearwater,AZ,27.9377704,-82.7290561,"18167 US Hwy 19 N, Ste 130",Positivo

+1/-1. Fish taco discussion can be like a political debate. Ok maybe I'm a fish taco snob??  Their fish tacos are not made with tilapia or even catfish, the menu says red drum.  But, the fish has a thick beer batter type coating that left me tasting all batter and no fish.

Romaine lettuce, Guac,Pico De Gallo,Cheese, grilled Veggies on Soft or Hard Shell. The thing that stood out was the fact their ground beef now has Chili Seasoning in it, and is flavorful! (Great Job Qdoba On this change,far more flavorful than in the past)
Queso and chip side added, one of us got crunchy shells,the other soft flower shells.

Second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! Really gotta shout out that this food is delish. Had a 'Supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!!

Drinks are not self serve through COVID-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00

Seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. And, a popular Mexican cable Music channel is broadcasted on a little 32"" TV hanging on the wall.

The store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. Half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. Please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. Personally, my family and I LOVE dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food. 

Gripe time. Not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'COVID'. There just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. It restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!)

HXJ1qmzRNu-fy3qKGyHc7w,Okay Bar,"Nightlife, Mexican, Bars, Restaurants, Dive Bars",5.0,"Okay Bar, you're so humble. Ugh, I dream about this bar. I stumbled upon it after a shit time at St. Roch. Found it on google and fell in love with the windows.

About a ten minute walk from Franklin, we ended walking in behind a guy who immediately asked the bartender to close his tab from last night. (Happened 3 more times that night lol)

It was a Thursday. If that's not a green flag -- idk what is.

The place looks just as cool in real life, unfortunately they were doing construction so one side of the bar is covered in black tarp while the rest looks sexy af.

For a while, we sat in silence and then ended up chatting to the bartender. He was very chill. Chatted us up, answered questions. Kepy the drinks flowing. Try their OKAY Negroni. I'm never going back to the classic.

After about an hour of just us, a couple came in through the back and seemed to know the bartender. It seemed like a first date, they stayed for a while and then bounced.

OK does what a lot of NOLA bars do-- a rotating kitchen staff. We had the Burger Nerd's chicken burger/chop cheese. 10/10

We eventually ended up staying for almost 7 hours. Meeting casual regulars, checking out the fucking awesome backyard and backroom. Talking music, bar scenes, and lifestyles (not the condom). The guy that came in earlier on his date came back! And we ended up chatting with him.

The bartender eventually told us his name, Brian. (Absolute King) And told us it was a quiet night and we should come back on Friday.

And BOY we did.

We showed up for a DJ set with SincJack and Mr. LegWork (the guy who came in on a date lol)  Brian remembered us and introduced us to a couple more regulars. We had Hottie's Tamales that night -- the tacos/quesadillas are a must.

Like almost every bar outside the French Quarter, it starts popping off at 10pm.

The vibe and the love of this bar is real. People are friendly and know each other and remember each other. At one point someone walked in and was like, ""Oh crap. I recorded a sex scene with your ex girlfriend 2 years ago."" and the other guys was like,""....OHH YEAHHH!! WHAT UP MAN!!!"" They ended up talking the WHOLE NIGHT.

Everyone did actually. 90% of the in the bar was sitting outside, ordering drinks for each other, and TALKING. It was incredible. 

My heart sings for it now. I wish this place was in NYC. We ended up heading to a different bar with some of the people we met there, and Brian and both DJs vouched for them saying we were in good hands. LIKE COMMUNITY. We did end up having a great night and trip just because our first night at Okay. Such a welcoming vibe and wholesome experience. I miss these guys and the energy here.

I think a lot of yelpers come here expecting to be spoon fed -- you bring good energy to a bar, and the bar will love you back.

Also, shout out to Michael Ball - I haven't met you but I heard you're a legend and I've experience the true power of fernet.

I love you Brian. I love you OK. I'm coming back just for ya'll.

The tacos looked good but as soon as I picked it up, it fell apart, straight out the bottom. There was no chance. It made it pretty difficult to eat, so i asked for a fork. Tacos should never have to be eaten with a fork, it's just sad.  I tried the quesadilla and it was fine, but nothing special. The margaritas were so strong that I couldn't even really enjoy it.

Molcajete - ($19)!  This is a melange of chicken,shrimp/beef/pork and peppers with cheese and avocado served in an igneous rock. It is accompanied by refried beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, pico de gallo, and three flour tortillas. It is very flavorful and a bit spicy. The fixings are fresh. The beans/rice are just solid. 4/5

House Margarita - ($7.50) . This was a medium strength drink and was good. Many of their drinks are regular or large sized.   4/5

Chips/salsa - Free (as it should be in ESE restaurants). The chips were crunchy and the salsa was solid. I would have liked a spicier salsa but oh well.

Service after being seated was prompt. they seem to leave you alone at least when I visited on a Sunday evening.

Cons:

When you enter, there is no server station. I was waiting for 5-7 minutes  and then was wandering around until a server tending to someone told me I could sit anywhere I wanted.

So saw all these bad reviews and went to check it out. I Did online mobile app ordering three different times of the day in a week before making my review.

The staff was friendly fast and each item ordered was made with care no smashed tacos, no cheap filled portions it was exactly like pictures show it was a great experience for me all three times !

1st was midday mid week a full order of chalupas and burritos with some Loco tacos the ones with the flavored shell fast and quick to order and pick up. 

2nd was late night weekend line of cars on Saturday night ordered on my way through the app. Got there and the line of cars whipped out fast within 4 min pretty fast for over 8 cars in line including mine.

3rd was a Tuesday evening on popular taco Tuesday and they were fast courteous and on point.

The reviews for delivery you might as well ignore most food isn't meant to be delivered and sit on wait for pickup and the on a drive to your house if want fresh fast and delicious go to the place !!

If your ordering from your couch expect couch expectations there are so many factors from your delivery driver to the traffic to how they handled your food it isn't right to review negative to the location itself try different times and then post in my opinion.

This location is joined with a gas station and does a great job of still having a drive thru with no traffic problems. With that said, this is a typical Jack in the Box and i do not have too much more to say about this one specifically. I think the loaded fries are the best item and they taste very good. The burgers are decent, but they are a little pricey for an average burger. With that said, the burgers are still great but there is some intense competition from other places. Also, there is often good deals but only for one burger at a time ($5.99 for chicken sandwich meal for example). Oftentimes those deals are for obscure burgers i have no interest in eating. I have encountered a problem where sometimes i will ask for no ice and they will still give me some.

When we were done the manager came with our checks and the coupon saying we cant use this with the special. I went and called the waiter because that's not what he said. The manager tried to waive it off and say we couldn't use it but after we explained what we were told I told him he should honor it since we were given incorrect information. He came back and gave us the money off our bill but after doing the math when we got home he pulled a fast one and charged us the regular fajita price not the special price to give us the coupon.

efxiiiwXpF2pEsCfgeQc8g,Juno,"Nightlife, Cocktail Bars, Restaurants, Mexican, Bars, American (New)",4.0,"Juno is a VIBE. The atmosphere was incredible and I would have loved to hang out all day if it weren't for the time limit placed on tables. Juno exclusively offers outdoor dining on their fenced in, not-middle-of-the-sidewalk patio with colorful chairs, string lights, and plants on plants on plants to create a fun, Instagram-able environment. 

We managed to snag a 12:30 brunch reservation the day prior and were seated immediately on arrival even though we wound up checking in early. Our table was well distance from the others around us, hand sanitizer was available, and all staff was appropriately masked. Our waitress greeted us promptly and our food was brought within a reasonable timeframe, though they bring it out as it's ready so BF got his meal a good 5 min before I got mine, which was a little awkward.

The food is just okay --- if it weren't for the atmosphere, I'd bump it down a star or two. We started with flavored margaritas, which are quite obviously their regular lime margaritas with a shot of flavored syrup because our syrup had settled to the bottom of the glasses. Once mixed together, they were pretty good but nothing extraordinary. 

We started with the guacamole and chips, which were fine. Our guac had a few brown spots, but tasted fresh but a little bland -- needed some extra salt or lime. 

BF ordered the al pastor tacos which were delicious though a bit salty. I chose the roasted vegetable tacos, which had eggplant, corn, peppers, and other mixed veggies with an avocado crema. My tacos were just okay and honestly I probably could have made something similar at home. Next time, I'll order something that I can't easily make on my own.

All in all, I'd go back again just to sit in the pretty garden with fun music and a colorful drink.",1,0,0,2020-09-11,IaX73WNkQtspGsF3Xwgm8w,Philadelphia,PA,39.9619437,-75.155644,1033 Spring Garden St,Positivo

j4byE3dWqJ590uKJ0Z2Z_A,El Indio,"Mexican, Restaurants",3.0,"I visited this restaurant during the coronavirus crisis. I was hungry and decided to be open-minded about this authentic mexican place. I heard there was cheap tacos, and this alone was enough for me to swing by!

1. The chips and salsa brought wonderful memories when I was in elementary school --- very simple Mexican food, not too strong and not too overpowering. The salsa was very thick and nice with minimal spice. Therefore, I think this chip and salsa is absolutely perfect for patrons with very mild tastebud.

2. The taco is very americanized. You'll get simple grounded beef or shredded chicken for $1.50 each. They are delicious with mild flavor. I'd like to kindly point out the following: There is no lime or salsa for these tacos; likewise, there is also no onions and cilantro. This is a bonus for patrons who cannot handle strong flavor associated with traditional Mexican food. Fortunately, there is morezella cheese, and you can't beat that! Shredded Iceberg lettuce is included in tacos.

3. If you're looking for more flavor, I highly recommend nachoamama, a few blocks away from this restaurant.

If you're looking for authentic taco with the classic cilantro & onion, I highly recommend the Taco and Ice Cream shop on Cherokee street. There are other authentic shops in the same vicinity that you may want to consider.

If you want authentic taco at an affordable price, I recommend La Gloria in Bridgeton.

4. This restaurant is great for cheap tacos on Monday & Tuesday. Each Mexican restaurant is different in Saint Louis. Hopefully this place is your next favorite place!

My wife and I just moved to the area and wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant that was more authentic versus a chain restaurant. We stumbled upon Los Aztecas and wanted to give it a shot, but that was a mistake. 

Location: The restaurant is located in a busy shopping center with ample parking. The inside is older and could use some updating, but very typical for a Mexican restaurant. 

Food: The food was just ok, nothing special. I got the tacos, which came out in less than 2 minutes after ordering. The chips and salsa were good with the perfect amount of salt. I'm assuming it's due to Covid, but I was given plastic silverware and my food was delivered in a metal pan - not really what I expected though. 

Other observations: the restaurant was completely empty, but a lot of the employees used the first couple of booths to hang out in, which to me doesn't seem like a great business model. There were also two kids running around the restaurant, which to me was extremely unprofessional as this place is very small.

I didn't quite love this place nor did I hate it; it was pretty much the definition of ""mediocre,"" though many abuelitas would be very offended at the food served here.

We ordered the gorditas to start, tequila lime chicken tacos, carne asada, and the Mexican hot chocolate.

The gorditas weren't bad, they were very generous with the filling and the carnitas were pretty good. 

The chicken tacos, however, were quite disappointing. The chicken was extremely dry and you couldn't really taste the lime flavour. It was kind of bland and I wouldn't really recommend it.The tortillas were good quality though.

Carne asada. I was most disappointed with this staple. The beef was tough and hard to chew, it was over cooked and dry. It was also really bland and needed some seasoning. 

The Mexican hot chocolate saved our experience at 3 Amigos. This was the best hot chocolate I've ever had. You could tell they used real chocolate and there was a hint of spice to it. This is a must order if you ever decide to come here to eat. 

Overall, my experience at 3 Amigos was mixed. The portions are quite small for what you pay for and the food wasn't the best. However, I'll forever be dreaming about the Mexican hot chocolate.",0,0,0,2020-01-07,Nldz71WY97I3SdP1xw2Sug,Edmonton,PA,53.4755251,-113.5045946,4035 106 Street NW,Positivo

Just slightly across the street from my hotel, so quick and easy to get too. Ordered to go, # 57118990, Home Wrecker white meat chicken burrito and medium size side of Guac. Came with plenty of chips, total was $18.28 and couple dollars cash in the tip jar. Happy I tried it but didn't find any real flavor I had hoped too in this TexMex called place. Might be spoiled with all the full Mexican flavors we have in So Cal.

Pros-
Guy and Girl working were both very nice people.
Lots of chips given.
Grab your own salsa bar with ok mild to hot selections.
Food prep area looked clean.
Burrito was fair size for price charged.

Cons-
Overall, I found the burrito and side of Guac without any zing, spice, or flavor, kind of borderline bland for my personal taste. Wasn't bad food, just not what I prefer.",0,0,0,2021-12-03,AbCK5PPtJMVEV3rBRBxctQ,Oldsmar,PA,28.037579516,-82.6580101777,"4011 Tampa Rd, Ste 14",Positivo

I had a pleasant experience at this new location. Having fallen out of like with Cinco de Brentwood more than a decade ago...I was reluctant to visit. The interior is much the same as previous tenants and the place feels family-run.

Yes, the crowd was large and the restaurant's short-staffed. Yes, some things arrived off the expected timeline and sequence. Chips were almost forgotten and arrived in a frenzy when the miss was noticed (staff noticed without being reminded!) The food was good. The margaritas were good. The service was friendly and the staff were gracious. It's what you want and a full house is good to see.

Tiffany is the manager on duty who clearly sets the tone for the team, and I believe the lady's name at the window was Shelly or Sherry. 

In any case, not only did she pleasantly welcome me to Taco Bell through the speaker and ask how my day was, she also responded & thanked me when I asked her how she was. (This is how guests should be engaged from the first moment of contact with a business!)

She took my order & confirmed it was correct, then upsold me a pop for an extra dollar! Now I don't normally drink pop, but it was so easy to say YES which is exactly what providing customer service that sells is all about: Increasing the value exchange for both the business and the customer!

My order was quickly & pleasantly delivered to me with a smile from everyone at the window and wound up being fresh and piping hot!

Chicken Pastelitos - huge crowd favorite. You get four puffy, fried pastelitos, with their lightly pickled red onions. Two pastelitos is enough for one meal, so enough to share or for leftovers. 

Montucas - the sweet corn Hondurian Tomale is so tasty it could be a dessert dish. Everyone devoured it. 

Guacamole - nice size portion, love the addition of the pickled red onions. Very fresh, a solid go to. 

Carne Asada Platillos Hondurenos - the meat is tender, and delicious. Great flavor. Comes with tender hand pressed tortillas. Enough for two. Mild spice.

My dad doesn't like super spicy dishes - he ordered the Pechuga a la Mexicana and was thrilled. The sauce had tons of flavor with a mild spice that was perfect for him. Chicken was tender and again, the portions were enough for two. 

By far the crowd favorite was the Chicharron pupusas. The pupusas come with a yellow slaw and the most fantastic dipping sauce. Use your hands, tear off some pupusas, pack some slaw in the middle, dunk and enjoy. Highly Highly recommend!

I know in my review I noted that several of these dishes are a mild spicy level, they send a collection of sauces with the order, that are perfect for upping the heat and flavor level even more. For myself and my wife, we love spicy food, and really enjoyed the sauces with our meal. 

I've ordered both on Grubhub, and in person. Both were incredible fast. Food arrived hot and fresh!",0,0,0,2021-04-05,eMnsQM2cdzcmBTzsRE-Iiw,Philadelphia,FL,39.9215268,-75.1582889,2201 S 7th St,Positivo

l_slvEnh4v3W8BXF1gYlcQ,Baja Sharkeez,"Mexican, Bars, Tex-Mex, Nightlife, Dance Clubs, Sports Bars, Restaurants",3.0,"Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday. The reason for us coming was to get a 84oz fishbowl or bucket for $35 to share. Turns out we weren't allowed to purchase that with just us two??(bullshit) that was the whole point of us coming. So we ended up getting the shark attack 21oz for our first round, then a 22 oz mango margarita and regular mega margarita for all $15 each. So we spent $30 each when we should have spent $35 for both of us for the bucket. Knowing this I would never come back unless it was at least 3 of us. Our bill came out to $89 for 4 $15 drinks, an order of chicken nachos, and an order of sliders. Fuck that.

Also the system is very strange, you sit where you want, then you go to the bar to order food and drinks, awkwardly standing there waiting for the bartender to finish his current drink for you to order, sometimes waiting a few minutes(very inefficient in my opinion).

The food was ok but I'm mainly upset that we couldn't get a bucket and the ordering system was strange.

Construction on Virginia Street was cumbersome, but we just parked behind the establishment on the frontage street and walked in.

Great modern building, bold colors and amenities.  Has 3 of these gorgeous glass bay garage doors, which would turn the restaurant into an open-air style dining experience, including their outdoor patio.  I can't wait for summer.  

We arrived early for lunch and staff was friendly, restaurant was ready for the lunch crowd.  We ordered our drinks and appetizer.  Nachos Supreme with chicken.  

Hella tasty.  Generous toppings including a delicious guacamole and a nice crema.  Distributed nicely among all the chips.

Entree we ordered was a tres fajitas.  Pollo, Asada y Camarones.  Chicken, steak and shrimp.  Served with arroz y frijoles.  We shared.  Plenty for all of us.  Also ordered the Asada Wet Burrito.  It was HUGE.  I mean big enough to feed a hungry man TWICE. 

For dessert we enjoyed a couple slices of caramel cheesecake, garnished with cream and orange slices.  Delicate, flavorful, sauce was bomb.

We loved the artwork, the ambiance and the food.  All three of us left STUFFED and carrying leftovers and our bill was just 60$.

I know they just opened another restaurant in Sparks, so I am looking forward to trying that location, as well as returning to the Downtown Reno location during the summer, when those gorgeous bay doors are open and the construction is complete on Virginia Street.

So I have to yell for the folks in the back. Use the Yelp Check-In Offer! Better yet use the offer and ask for the bean dip. It's a bowl of queso with refried beans in it! Mix it around with your fresh tortilla chips and hot damn you'll be delighted. Now cheese is an important food group for any diet (don't fact check me) so make sure to order this alongside their queso fundido (melted cheese in a mini skillet with big chunks of chorizo). The queso fundido is oh so gooey and drips everywhere. JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.

Ask for extra bowls of chips and salsa btw, you're going to kill them very very easily.

Now they have a happy hour that's pretty competitive y'all. We went on a Sunday and they were offering $4 margaritas that had a nice punch to them.

The salsa was good also.  I tried their hot tomatillo salsa and would reccomend it if you like you salsa spicy.  The wait staff was polite and attentive for the most part.  The waiter forgot my wife's refill at one point but that was not a big thing.
My wife was impressed with the decor and she felt it made it morw authentic.   I think it played more to the suburban aesthetic but I think it works for them.

What a phenomenal transformation from the Clermont Skillet Restaurant to 3 Agaves Mexican Restaurant. 3 Agaves purchased the Hemp Shop next door to the Clermont Skillet allowing for a larger restaurant plus a small patio. The exterior has been painted a bright red and green so it stands out and is easy to see. The parking issue is still a problem, especially if 3 Agaves becomes popular, since they only have nine parking spaces in the back of the building. The bank has agreed to allow parking which will help the parking situation.

You no longer enter through the back of the restaurant but off the entrance at the corner of the restaurant by the stop light by the patio. The hostess stand is just inside the door. 

The new restaurant is much larger, configured well with different size tables, booths and seating at the bar. I can't wait for folks to enjoy this new, well thought-out layout of this terrific new restaurant with good food and drinks. This is the third 3 Agaves in the Central Indianapolis area with locations in Avon, Camby and now Clermont.

The menu is diverse with many of the favorite appetizers, soups, salads, burritos, enchiladas, tacos,  fajitas, plus more of the house specialities. I enjoy the Enchiladas Cajun with shrimp and cheese, onions and tomato sauce. The various entrees are delicious and pick your favorite.

Over the years I have tried other items La Mesa sells and I haven't liked anything enough to become a repeat customer. For me the tortillas are too thick and not round enough. If you like to eat one or two at a time it is hard because they stick together. If you heat multiple tortillas at one time it might not be an issue. I have tried the beef and chicken tamales. I think they are very dry compared to the green corn tamales. I have also bought tortillas chips here. The chips were fine but also on the expensive side. Their salsa wasn't good at all.

Quetzally is a small local Mexican restaurant in South Philly. They have a simple no frills decor and limited seating space. It's more of a pick up and go place, but it's nice to eat there if they aren't full. When I went, they originally seated me and my friend at a four person table and then asked to move us when a group of five came in. They were nice about it and let us pick from the remaining two tables where we wanted to sit. 

As for the food: The veggie enchiladas at Quetzally are probably the best I've had in Philadelphia so far. We were also served a basket of tortilla chips with fresh red and green salsas. That was nice since a lot of places in Philly don't do that. As for the enchiladas, I had the chance to try the mole and red sauce enchiladas.. both were very tasty. Personally I prefer the red sauce because of its tangy and spicy flavor profile. I found mole to be too sweet for my palette. Nacho fries were good, but I don't know if I see myself getting them often or again. They're definitely worth a try though!

They mixed in avocado, tomato, lettuce, beans, rice, & cilantro.  The server brought out sour cream & a delicious salsa which we topped every bite with.  The flavor combo was equivalent to deliciousness-on-steroids.  Sure, the price of each burrito was the higher price found on my menu.

RVzroffkQf6P8uv4qCBh8w,Sync Exton,"Gastropubs, Nightlife, Mexican, Tapas Bars, Restaurants, Bars, Pizza, American (New), Tacos, Burgers",3.0,"**This review is for RED STAR CRAFT HOUSE** 

Let me preface this by saying our table of 7 had our entire meal (alcoholic drinks included) comped by management. Which honestly was the only way I was going to be remotely happy after what happened during our visit. However, I still wanted to write a Yelp review for details on what happened and to give notes/feedback/hopefully something the restaurant can use for improvement.

This was my first time at Red Star Craft House.

I came to celebrate a friend's birthday this past Saturday evening (May 26th), a party of 7. We had made a reservation for 8:30pm and were promptly seated. To be specific, we had seen their 'The Office' bar trivia event on Facebook and wanted to participate as the birthday girl is a huge fan of the show. 

Once we were seated, the troubles began. Our server came to greet us and took our drink orders. We were left to look over the menu.... we decided on our appetizers and meals. Still no server or drinks. We waited some more. Eventually someone in our group went looking for a manger as we had not received our drinks or had our order taken after about 20 minutes of waiting. The manager came to our table to apologize and say he would take our order in just a second. Then our server returned, sans drinks, to take our food order. Our drinks arrived shortly thereafter.

Then we waited. After 20 more minutes, we began to give up that this was a salvageable night. Every time our server came to ""check on us"" without any explanation of where our food was or how long it was going to take, we explained that we just wanted our food. There was no reason to keep checking on us as we only became more and more irritated with the situation. Eventually we did receive our appetizers and meals. I would say this was a decidedly long time after we were seated, because one person in our party had to leave around 10:30pm & he had about half an hour to eat his meal once the food arrived. 

The cherry on top? My boyfriend's beer had a bug in it and I found a hair in my fajita wrap. 

At this point, the manager came over to apologize again and comp our meals. I was very pleased with how he handled our table and happy we did not have to fight for a resolution to an abysmal meal. 

What I wasn't supper happy about was what we observed during our waiting and the excuse as to why the service was so awful. Many in our group are former servers/bartenders/restaurant staff, so we at least know the basics, if not Red Star's specific policies:

1. The restaurant was at capacity, with practically every seat filled. If they can't handle the place at full capacity, then they have too many tables/seats. The patio wasn't even open/sat due to the weather. A restaurant/kitchen should be able to handle a butt in every seat without fail. If not, then there are too many seats. 

2. We were told they were understaffed because it was a holiday weekend and they thought people would be going down the shore. First, on a HOLIDAY WEEKEND, you should always have MORE staff, not less. Not everyone goes to the beach on Memorial Day weekend, add to it that the weather forecast was awful and many (including myself & my boyfriend) decided to scrap their beach plans. Even on a nice weather weekend, a lot of people stay local and have a cookout- but they still need to eat other meals that weekend. I've never seen a restaurant or retailer that put less staff on during a holiday weekend; you put MORE and cut if needed. 

3. They were offering 'The Office' bar trivia/quizzo. Honestly, the Facebook event alone had over 100 people say they were ""going"" or ""interested"". That should have been a tip-off that the restaurant had a high possibility it would be busy. 

All-in-all, it looks like just some poor management of the schedule was what did them in. Maybe offering quizzo on holiday weekend was not the best idea. Saturday nights are busy for a restaurant as it is... adding a bad weather holiday weekend and trivia on top is just a disaster waiting to happen. 

While we were taken care of unquestionably great by the manager, and I've heard good things about this place, I'm not sure I'll be returning any time soon. My first visit left a bad impression that will be hard to forget.",1,0,0,2020-01-26,U6cYPmvCxnR0flCG8VEcgA,Exton,PA,40.0304985,-75.6237639,146 Exton Square Mall,Positivo

True, it is tiny (2 tables inside and 2 more out front), and it is a dive (in the best sense of the word), but the skilled hands in la cocina tell a different tale.

When I parked on the street in front and walked in, a telenovela was playing on the HDTV high on the wall, and several people were working behind the counter. I approached to check their trifold menu and engaged the man who appeared to be the owner or manager. He was fluently bilingual making it easy to explain what was available and then how I wanted my Torta Milanesa de Pollo prepared.

I took a chair at one of the tables, and moments later my lunch was placed before me. It was an enormous sandwich on an oversized oblong roll, dressed in heavy foil at its waist and showing its internals at its edges. Just take a look at the photos. It was an amazing piece of working peoples culinary art.

I maneuvered my jaws for a first bite and attempted to compress the width of this monster to fit more in my mouth. I clamped down full force and cut through its many layers. The flavor of the breaded cutlet, spicy mayo, avocado, tomato, onion, queso and lettuce burst out and had a fiesta in my mouth complete with pinata. It was just an excellent sandwich. Eating half would have been enough for a satisfying meal, but I indulged and ate the whole thing right there. 

Totopos has been in business for about three years. The family running it is from Oaxaca in southern Mexico. They give this corner of North Trenton another reason to visit along with some of the other great hidden kitchens in the neighborhood.

When I arrived I realized it is the old Tortas Guicho Dominguez restaurant. I asked if the owners were the same and the server told me it was new owners, but they kept some of the same tortas and concepts. 

The outside of the building looks beautiful with that fresh coat of white paint and the inside is even more impressive! They put more stained glass inside to match the original on the building and I love that! They also arranged the seats in a more inviting way and gave the bar a really nice update. The whole place was very esthetically pleasing. 

The cheese sauce was wonderful! Thick and nicely flavored! Probably the best cheese sauce I've had. The chips were homemade, which was a nice treat. They were also delicious! 

I tried the torta ahogada. I hd never had one before and wanted to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised that the bread wasn't too soggy. The sauce was flavorful and the carnitas were seasoned well. 

My friend ordered an alambre and really liked it as well.

The medium-heat salsa verde was more dull and limey than expected. Guacamole was average. And the queso sadly just tasted like bland white American cheese, melted and then mixed with diced tomatoes. Would've been better with jalapenos, or any kind of heat, but I guess they were out of it.

Employees here were relatively aloof and quiet, probably working too long behind the counter. But at least around them were puns and stories on the walls to keep attention of anyone interested.

The produce section is small, but loaded with tons of peppers fresh greens and a lot of fruits. The prices here are comparable with Kroger, but I would say your dollar goes a little farther here than at most grocery stores. 

What do I love most about shops like these, is all of the specialty items you can't find at a normal chain. Like tons of dehydrated chilis; arbol, guajillo, and ancho chilies.

We've tried several of their offerings, at this point, and each time we've been impressed. The service is courteous, friendly and timely. The owner/manager has gone out of his way to make up for our initial experience, and they have more than earned our repeat business. We highly recommend them and their delicious food.

The shredded chicken that it came with was really good and not bland at all. You could tell that their tortillas were  homemade as they were all different shapes and sizes, plus they tasted really good too :) Our server was this sweet redhead who was super friendly and we had a pretty good time. Though I was really disappointed with the beef that the taco bar came with. Whenever I had a taco with beef on it I felt like I was eating a taco bell taco. There wasn't much flavor to their hot sauce or chipotle mayo (I honestly couldn't even taste them in my tacos but I knew they were there because they were dripping onto my hands). My husband really liked the beef, but I just thought it was dry and bland. Overall a good experience and reasonably priced. I mean the taco bar for $10 on Tuesdays was such a good deal and there were unlimited refills on the toppings so it was basically all you can eat for $10 a person. We all got margaritas that were pretty tasty. I had the happy hour fresh strawberry and my husband got the spicy one, it wasn't very spicy but it wasn't half bad either :) I'd definitely come here again but I'd wanna try the upgraded fajita bar instead of the taco one.

ap5bxhjMs3f4alh7Zu51nQ,Superica,"Restaurants, Mexican, Nightlife, Tex-Mex, Bars",3.0,"Update: I used to like this place but the portions keep getting smaller and the prices keep going up. Still not a bad restaurant but I simply can't recommend it as a good value.



I'm a huge lover of both traditional Mexican cuisine as well as the U.S. regional variants (New Mexican, Cali-Mex, Tex-Mex, etc.), and given the dearth of quality places for any of those in this area I was eagerly anticipating the opening of this restaurant. While there were some ups and downs, overall my experience was positive and I will definitely be returning.

For starters the service was excellent, even on opening night when you might have reasonably expected some issues. There weren't any, so kudos for that.

The margaritas were refreshing, very well-balanced, and reasonably strong. The house margarita is a very clean-tasting drink that goes down smooth and easily, as opposed to a bolder-flavored margarita that lends itself more to slow sips (they have other margaritas on the menu that may fall more into that category.) Uncle Julio's (my favorite place for margaritas in the area) also has the latter style covered so it's nice to have the variety.

Their table salsas are also excellent and along with the salsa at Habanero Grill rank among the best in the area. The avocado verde salsa is clean and refreshing while the roasted tomato salsa has a nice smoky taste to it. I tend to prefer my salsas on the hotter side and wish they would have had a bit more of a kick to them (or that there was a good habanero salsa as an option), but the flavors are there and easily blow away the salsas at just about every other area restaurant. 

The chips are a bit less impressive and lack that addictive quality that make you want to eat a basketful on their own, but they're light and crisp and the salsas give you all the flavor you could want, so while not a huge positive I wouldn't consider the chips a negative.

I'm less enthusiastic about the queso. The bar for queso is set extremely low in this area (don't even get me started on the gloppy, flavorless white ""cheese dip"" on the menu of every generic gringo-Mex establishment in this vicinity) so in that respect it ranks as one of the better quesos in the city, but while it at least has some flavor to it that flavor is a bit one-note - it could have really benefitted from the inclusion of some fresh chiles, and after a while I found myself putting it aside in favor of the far superior salsas. Chuy's still reigns supreme for queso in the area, which in itself is a sad commentary on the state of Middle Tennessee queso.

I also wasn't very impressed with the steak tacos, especially for $17. The guacamole that came on top was absolutely delicious, but the steak itself was chewy and lacked seasoning; the rice and beans on the side were also pretty bland. Habanero Grill remains the area champ for all three. I also think I made a mistake ordering them Rico-style, which I took to mean with queso added but which turned out to be served enchilada-style drowned in the stuff. Given my earlier comments on the queso you can guess what effect this had. Next time I try the tacos I'll definitely get the standard versions with their salsa cremosa - if it's anything like their table salsas that's definitely the way to go.

All things considered I think there's a lot to like about this place. While it hasn't dethroned any of my favorite places for individual items, it does a number of things quite well, and at the very least seems like it'll be a great happy hour spot for margaritas, chips, and salsa. And while the queso and steak tacos were disappointing, and the entree prices are quite high in general, there are a lot of things on the menu that you can't get at most other restaurants in the area and I'm looking forward to trying them. Their brunch menu also appears much more reasonably priced and if they can do a good Tex-Mex breakfast that alone will justify their addition to the local culinary scene. In short, while it's final ranking will be determined by repeat visits, I think this place has potential and is a welcome addition to the Nashville area.",0,1,0,2020-01-07,LQtKyr2Wqw36XrIJ8_dFYA,Nashville,PA,36.151818,-86.782679,605 Overton St,Positivo

I haven't found many places that cook in the style of my family's home country. I felt right at home. I ordered their pozole, one of my favorite dishes. This is the first time I find a white pozole instead of red, which is rare but native to our region. This made me so happy that I could finally order white pozole in a Mexican restaurant!!! I also ordered two chorizo tacos and champurrado. I had just gotten back from a trip to India and I missed out on all the Mexican Christmas food. I somewhat made it up by ordering from this place. The tacos were delicious! The pozole was a bit salty and the maize was a bit undercooked, but it was still very tasty. I would highly recommend visiting this place.

B_ULY8xaOEx4PZxauoSmow,California Mexican Food,"Mexican, Restaurants",3.0,"I have no idea what makes ""California Mexican"" food. I'm not a connoisseur and I've lived in Idaho my whole life. But this place tasted like every other drive-through Mexican place we have in the valley. 

Ok, firstly some positives:

Drive through. Lol. If you've read any other reviews I've posted, you know I love me a drive through. For obvious reasons. 

The portions were super generous! Look at that kid's bean and cheese burrito. That thing was MASSIVE. It fed both my kids (I mean, they're 4 and 1, but still!) and their dad polished it off. The rice and beans were adult size portions too. 

The price is very affordable. We ordered the kid's burrito combo and the chimichanga combo and it all amounted to $12.50. Not bad at all. 

The rice was nice. Fluffy, well seasoned, and not crunchy. 

The negatives: 

My chimichanga was supposed to be shredded beef, but it was more like 5/6 beans and 1/6 shredded beef. I had to dig the beans out. It was also very lightly fried, so the bottom was really gooey by the time we got home. I guess I've learned something new about myself. If I get something fried, I want some serious commitment to that fry! :)

The beans were gluey and bland. Again, I AM NOT AN EXPERT, but these tasted straight from a can with melted cheese on top. I like beans to be a bit runnier and even a bit...creamy? 

They gave us two types of hot sauce, but didn't ask for requests, so I''m not sure if this is all they offer. I did not care for either. The red one was very hot and overwhelmed each bite. The tomatillo one was so mild and bland. There was no happy medium. Bummer.

If I'm driving past and want a quick taco, I might swing back through. But I won't make a special trip.",10,3,4,2020-03-12,G0Ex17NeMJUwqNIl8Z4ecw,Boise,PA,43.6191396,-116.3178746,10889 W Fairview Ave,Positivo

They come with rice, beans, lettuce, salsa, the works. Total came to just under $20. 

They call to let me know my order is ready and I retrieve two football sized burritos and some side salsas. Got home, said our grace (bless the meat, let's eat) and tore into them. Everything was really good and obviously we got a decent portion. The carnitas could've used a bit more caramelization and salt,  and the chicken could've used some more seasoning as well.

It reminds me a lot of two deep, but with better food. I think the atmosphere is something they could work on just coming from the other location a few weeks ago. Their outdoor space and ability to host larger crowds will be a big advantage for them soon I think. 

We had the avocado fries and the asian brisket tips for appetizers. Both delicious! The asian brisket tips are probably what I will get for my meal the next time. They were that good.

I had the Beast burger. It was a little bit of a letdown really. It's their most expensive burger and has a very tasty sounding blend of wagyu beef, elk, boar, and bison. I added pepper jack cheese. It was just eh. Not a ton of flavor. It was not bad, just not great, as the price would make it seem like it should be. The fries that came with it were really good. 

The other people in our group got the chicken quesadilla (very tasty), the beer mac (very good), and the Texas BBQ brisket sandwich. Honestly, that brisket sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! The flavor was full and savory. It wasn't too salty. It wasn't too heavy. It had the perfect blend of spices, meat, cheese, and bread that created a delectable bite! I know I mentioned the brisket tips earlier, but this is thing I am getting next time. 

I know I didn't mention much about the beer, which is odd since this is a brewery, but in this case it is not a bad thing. We tried several different beers and each one was as good as the one before. I did not have anything that I did not like in their beer lineup.

We came about a half hour before closing on a Thursday, the staff was friendly, and the food was quick and hot, and they didn't pressure us out while they were closing up. Just started cleaning and let us finish our drinks. I would highly recommend this place for your dining and drinking pleasure.

I'll be loving tacos who doesn't tired of Taco Bell decided you know what let's give it a shot so I walked in it was extremely clean that's one thing I could say they've done an excellent job of keeping it very clean everything distance to properly and Marked  very well.

their menu is nice-sized very easy to read the board the cashiers and the Sur counter staff or very nice and professional this is staffed by loves just like most loves food is this one is definitely also with the exception of McDonald's which they don't have contracts with. show right next to the godfather's Pizza Express in the other place is the Taco John's.
founded in 1969 that's now a fifty-one-year-old franchise chain they have standalone stores like many other Taco joints but mostly further out west is where they're located.

so I decided to get the classic Taco combo I'm like Taco Bell where it's always three and a drink here at Taco John's it's too and a drink because one they have larger size shells and two they fill the taco all the way up not halfway and then stop. so I got the two beef tacos next time I'm going to get the potato ole's which are like seasoned hash browns I opted to get the nachos with my combo. 
they called my number I went over and got my drink the fountain drink is open and found a place to sit.

sitting down what you do find here are the signs that let you know these tables have been sanitized in the proper ones are marked off for covid. opening up my bag and pulling out the tacos the first thing I did notice as I mentioned was now nice and large the tacos were like a Mexican restaurant style.the lettuce and the tomato was seem nice and fresh I went with the extra for the sour cream cuz I like it one thing about Taco John's I do like is there beef it's seasoned really well and has a nice taste to it it was really impressed. the nachos however the reason I'll next time go with the potato O'le I think they're called.. the nachos although they were abundant in the large bag could have probably fed a family at 3 the first cup of cheese I got was cold they gave me another hot one which was nice but the seem like they were fried in the oil a little too long before they put them out because somewhere nice fresh and crunchy but then some kind of yucky and they were like soggy and hard like they were just nothing but Grease.. but the main thing the tacos with tasty so it's all good.
what I come back here yes I definitely would I would come back here more often since I come through here quite a bit on Interstate 65 indeed!  a very good and hopefully it stays that way;

The lettuce they used looked as if it was has been sitting out. I didn't care for the one large half of a tomato. The crust had a very nasty cooler taste like they just leave them siting in a refrigerator and letting that recycled air get absorbed int the shell. The cheese sauce was good. Asked and paid for grill jalapeños but they were missing. Hardly had any chicken in my chicken fajita taco salad. The chips and the salsa are really good. I asked for their hottest salsa and it was unbelievably horrible. It tasted like burnt seasoning. No flavor what so ever. Good price point but that's obvious once you taste the food.

However my experience wasn't what I had hoped for. 

When I first entered Barcade you'll walk into an average bar. However at night, this place was really dimly lit and somewhat dingy and dirty. At the bar, it took a while for the bartender to get my order. Probably because they didn't see me in the dark =). I ordered a rum and coke that came out to be $9. I thought this was a bit expensive than usual. 

After the underwhelming drink. I hit up the arcade part. This part was pretty good and throws you back in the height of the 90s with games such as X-Men, Area 51, Ninja Turtles, Simpsons Arcade, Sniper, The Avengers. You'll have to get to the dollar to quarters machine to get your change, just like back in the day! Also most machines are 25 cents to play with the more popular games are 50 cents, again just like how it was in the 90s. I spent a good 45 minutes playing and revisiting my childhood.

It's a mexed slaw, pico de gallo, a dunk sauce drizzle and a large slice of fried avocado.  The other was the willie good taco.

h8TJV8clolcjqp9aFV4OjQ,Sunny Daze Cafe,"Diners, Tex-Mex, Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Mexican, Burgers",5.0,"As suggestions go, this one is worth hearing about. Tucson staples tend to have a feel and menu somewhere between soup and mix and match. I don't believe I am jaded about the food scene in Tucson, but definitely weary when someone says they have been in Tucson for ever. Companies get complacent, but I digress. The pink flamingo motif does stab you right in the eye and make you a little Leary about their ability to present food. But it's part of the shtick. Beach bumming and home cooking. Come inside and your greeted with the specials for the whole day, breakfast lunch and dinner. Unless you can read what appears to be hieroglyphs I'm not sure anyone would catch what it says without a bit of studying. 
Around the corner that reminds me of a dive bar and the place opens up to what I could only associate with the finest diner experiences of my youth. Carousel dessert stocked with cinnamon rolls, brownies and I hope pies in the afternoon. (I didn't stay that long). An ancient register, counter with every assortment of restaurant cutlery possible, for prep and placement on tables. There wasn't many people at 930am. It the staff was already running. Window to the kitchen where more than 6 people were sitting at stations head down focused. 
I was quickly grabbed and placed at a table and given menus and quickly asked about drink choices.
Waitress was friendly and interested. Gave me time to go over the menu. Now, it must be said, this menu is large. Packed with things to order, but not confusing.  It if you wear glasses. Do not forget them. The print is small. Finding something on the menu isn't that hard though. I settled for the biscuit and gravy combo. 2 eggs, 2 biscuits cut in half and 2 sausages. Side of hash browns and my wife and I shared a cinnamon roll.
Fast is not a description in this places book. Lightening is. Now, when someone says that, one might immediately think Chef Mike is on the case. Which means blah food and super duper hot. Nothing could be further from the case. This place may never win a Michelin Star, but they run the place like they mean to serve people good food fast. Everything came out quickly, I was surprised by the size of the sausages, hash browns were spot on and eggs were perfect. Biscuits and gravy were well seasoned and the extra sausage in the gravy added a nice texture. The cinnamon roll was def warmed in a microwave, but, it was warmed in the same way I would warm a donut at home a day later. It was great and really brought out the warm home feeling. It was at this point in my breakfast that I realized I was even in a restaurant instead of a diner in my home state of anywhere. The speed, sincerity, thought and I'd almost say love this place puts in the food sent me back to my childhood without even knowing it and I think that's the magic that is Sunny Days. You MUST experience it. If your missing home, go by and relive growing up and having that weekend breakfast.

zlVXs63KhHXx7n-vnhyITw,Costa Vida Fresh Mexican Grill,"Salad, Tex-Mex, Restaurants, Mexican",4.0,"I kept hearing this place is better than chipotle, so I wanted to go try for myself. Let's break it down:
Service: 2/5 - honestly, disappointed. There were four people 'working' but only one seemed to be actually working. While the first person explained my options to me and prepped my burrito, the second person decided to stock everything while I was standing there, even though there was a line behind me. She also did not answer any of my questions, leaving me disappointed and without some of the toppings I would've wished for. My friend was a few people behind me and it took them about 20 minutes to get through the two people before him and serve him. I could've almost gotten a sit down meal in that time!
Freshness: 3/5 - while the meat looked decently fresh, the 'fresh' guacamole they took out was completely brown but they did not seem concerned. They also happily mixed the fresh ingredients with the rest of the old ingredients. Their tortillas are so fresh though, which is great.
Taste: 4.5/5 - honestly, the burrito was filled to the brim and the taste was delicious after I added my own hot sauce (which I never got a chance to add since they ignored my question). The mango salsa was also fresh and delicious. This gave me two meals, and the Chile verde (seasonal) is a pork with a little kick.

zC7xWf8CTkYtDbwQHFetNg,Mariscos El Pulpo Restaurant,"Restaurants, Mexican",5.0,"I moved to Seminole in June 2019 and have always mixed my favorite Mexican restaurant in Jacksonville.  I searched and tried quite a number of establishments (each with great reviews) but was sadly always disappointed.  That was until my wife and I wandered in here.  Let me start by saying that my 5 stars are in context to Mexican Restaurants.  This is an unassuming place with little to no ambiance.  Most importantly the place was clean.  The building is back off the street in a strip mall.  The sign states Mexican Restaurant in large letter with Mariscos El Pulpo in small letters underneath.
The proprietors are very friendly and engaging.  The menu is vast and the food is awesome.  The guacamole was so fresh I could taste every ingredient in it.

It was fairly quiet for a Saturday early evening, and we had our choice of tables.  

Server was friendly enough.  Menus are via QR code.  Decided we'd have a beer each and when I had asked a question of one of the local breweries that was being served, the server had no idea of the beer, and had to call the 'bartender' over and even this person was without clue.  Nevermind, I'll just have a Corona then.  Considering the place was nearly empty, the servers (in plain sight), were chatting and joking with each other, meanwhile no beer had hit my table yet.  

Decided to go with the Fish Taco plate and the Al Pastor, and the Papas con Frijoles (Potato and refried bean).  The meals were very tasty.  Although each of the tacos is about the size of your palm (quite small).  

Overall, the Food is delish, small(ish) portion sizes, and a very cool vibe inside with great music playing.  The servers were friendly but seemed a bit clued out.

I asked for water with no ice (not realizing it was going to be room temperature water). No biggie though, I still drank it because I was thirsty. 

The waitress brought over nachos with refried beans and a side of hot sauces. I've never had nachos served that way, but they were great. The sauces were a bit too spicy for me. 

I ordered a Championes (mushroom) quesadilla and was told shortly thereafter that they were out of mushrooms! I was a little sad, but I had them whip up a veggie quesadilla instead using the ingredients that were inside the vegetarian burrito. It was nice that they were able to accommodate my request. The quesadilla was the bomb. The tortilla was flaky and buttery and the ingredients inside stayed put. Very good flavor and a decent portion. 

They don't have Tapatio or Tabasco hot sauces in a bottle, only house-made sauces. I also don't remember seeing dessert on the menu and I would have loved me some fried ice cream.

wIA1MwjA2kNgi6DfE9mxQg,Moe's Southwest Grill,"Tex-Mex, Mexican, Restaurants",3.0,"The most important takeaway from this review is that the food was VERY good. It's a chain and very similar to Qdoba and Chipotle. Walk through the line - Subway style - and pick your ingredients. I had the nachos and really liked the adobo chicken over the white meat chicken sold elsewhere. The chips were fresh and not overly thick (like stadium nachos - ugh!) and I liked the cheese. Also, they offered pickled jalapeños which did I don't think are an option at Qdoba. The serving was huge and I couldn't finish it - and I'm not a little guy! Due to the pandemic, they had to close their ""salsa"" bar so there were only 4 choices and I had to pick one. #3 and it was just ""OK"" so I'd have liked to sample more choices. Hopefully soon...
Complaints:
1st complaint: The place was trashed! It was 7:00 on a Tuesday night so not sure how busy they were but tables, floors, and overflowing trash abounded. Never saw anyone come out to address any cleanliness issues in the 30 minutes we were there. In fact, I had to clean my own table before we could use it!
2nd complaint: Those thin, cheap, and next-to useless napkins! Many chains have gone to these as a cost saving measure but try to eat Mexican food - burritos, tacos, and nachos and not have to wipe your face and hands after every bite! These were only one degree better than setting out Kleenex tissues! Come on corporate bean counters - give us some napkins with substance. I DARE any of you from the home office to eat at your own restaurants with only 4 of these napkins! We went back to the napkin station so many times, it probably cost you MORE than if you would've given us thicker ones to start with!",0,0,0,2021-04-14,n9GaZ_kxv03a86UrRtm1LA,Franklin,PA,35.9456406795,-86.8283618549,401-A Cool Springs Blvd,Positivo

The queso is always good , salsa is chunky my favorite texture. Kinda Spicy for a Irish girl but I like it. Chips are hot and fresh the time I went. And they dealt with my extra self getting separate boxes due to my OCD. Happily they obliged and they always kept my water full.

There are constantly different people when I go which means people come and go often. One time, I gave the lady at the window money for the order and she gave me more than I gave her back in change. I was trying to explain what happened when the manager was walking by so he wanted to know what was going on.

NkO7yOwVCDsB8rWlyZfEUQ,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"Restaurants, Mexican, Fast Food",3.0,"The new Chipotle in the Creek View shopping center opened a week ago in what was formerly TGI Friday's. The big positive above the old shop in Valley Square is that this one has a drive thru - although not of a typical sort. You cannot order in this lane, it is just for picking up mobile orders. When you order on the app you need to select the ""chipotlane"" or indoor pickup. 
They give you a pick up time which I'll say is fairly accurate. I got there early and had to wait but I don't believe it was any later than the original time. 
There also are some parking spots which I'm assuming are for incase there is a backed up line you can pull ahead and park and wait. I will say the drive thru area is pretty tight when exiting especially if there are cars parked there. 
Now on to what you care about - the food! I will say I mostly stopped going to the chipotle in Warrington because their quality was so hit or miss. It seems like that hasn't really changed. The chips were over cooked, there was a piece of the avocado pit in my guac, and the rice was a bit mushy like it hadn't finished cooking and was real clumpy. The taste was still good though, which I guess is what counts and it was a decent size bowl. Not packed, not skimpy. The mild salsa was fresh, the veggies weren't over cooked and the chicken was tasty! 
I didn't receive enough silverware with my meal either. 
The staff was nice! Which is a plus, but they always are. I'm sure things will improve once they work out the kinks after being opened a little longer.

So flipping good!) and the Baja fish as our fillings, beans, chipotle slaw (everything yes about that!!), and the Mexican street corn (amazing!) were our sides. The salsa verde with the homemade tostada style chips was so good that we kept whatever we didn't eat for later! We also ordered the margarita carafe (said it made 4 drinks but I'm not too sure about that one. We made three). I was very nervous about the process because I ordered this online at 4pm the day of and figured it would be a nightmare to pick up.

We have always found the staff to be polite and very knowledgeable about the menu. Today, our server, Michael H, was fantastic - the right balance of attentiveness without making us feel rushed. At his suggestion, I tried the steak and blue cheese quesadilla ... it was fantastic.  The tender filet strips, caramelized onions, and smooth texture of the queso and blue cheese crema produces a tasty twist on a standard texmex menu item.  My wife had the fish tacos which she must've really enjoyed because there were only crumbs left by the time I thought to ask for a taste.

It wasn't busy by 1pm. We were seated right away with our waitress taking our drink orders and bringing chips and salsa. Both were fresh. Salsa spicy, chips were not warmed. I ordered the chicken chimichangas on a bed of queso and which were served with beans, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes. Very good flavor. $13.45. My son ordered ACP, which we formerly knew as chicken on the beach. $14.95. Extra queso was $4.95! Whoa. Wasn't expecting that. We saved space to try their fried ice cream. It was $4.99 and was a huge portion to share. Served in a tortilla shell, coated in corn flakes and garnished with whipped cream, chocolate syrup and colorful sprinkles. The fried ice cream was just okay. The corn flakes tasted stale and were not crispy. Our drinks were $5.25 for two non-alcoholic beverages.
Overall, the meals were generously portioned. I wouldn't recommend the fried ice cream but maybe one of their other desserts would be better.

ZC2UYrfv92LcU7n-s3Awqw,Garcia's Mexican Restaurant - Cool Springs,"Restaurants, Mexican",4.0,"Felt like trying this place out since I was craving Mexican food and margaritas (when am I NOT craving that) and I live less than 5 minutes away. Sometimes the stars do align...

I immediately noticed that they have a ""patio,"" which is the front portion of the restaurant. Since it's winter the garage style glass windows were rolled down, but in the summer I can imagine how dreamy it gets when they're rolled up, creating an open concept with fresh air. It's very vibey.

Starting with chips and salsa: I enjoyed their light, airy and crispy chips with their mild salsa roja. My husband who prefers a little kick, asked for a spicier salsa and they brought one out which he was happy with.

Though not advertised, we stumbled in (and out!) during their happy hour margarita special, where their house margarita was $5. We could not say no and it was delicious and pleasantly strong.

As for their food, I would definitely not call this authentic (us snobby Californians have our own standards) nor your run-of-the-mill tex-mex place. I would liken it to a ""level up"" in Mexican food, on par to what Sopapillas may serve, but more affordable. On Garcia's website, they call themselves ""Mexican fine dining"" but I wouldn't go that far.

My husband went crazy over their tacos al pastor. I absolutely loved my slow roasted pork enchiladas (enchiladas yucatecas). The option of black beans was a nice change from the traditional refried. If I had to give one negative remark, it would be their rice. It is basically an American style rice pilaf with barely there flavor. Ugh. 

Feeling extra perky, I treated myself to a slice of their tres leches cake. It was so good! I feel like I'd have to get that again in spite of usually opting out of dessert!

My other guest enjoyed the lomo saltado which included steak mixed with veggies and french fries topped with 2 fried eggs and had white rice and fried plantains on the side. She really liked it too.

Had pulled pork corn tortilla tacos and a cauliflower chicken bowl. The quite large pieces of pork were very wet coming out of the pan. This doesn't work well with a single corn tortilla. Ended up eating with a spork.  Not easy to cut the pork with a pliable plastic spork.  The pork was next to tasteless. Needed salt and spices and to have the fat cut off of it.  Finding a way to heat up the pork and dry it out a bit would have helped. 
Not one to eat a cauliflower bowl I'm trusting that it was as good as she said it was. Had lots of flavor and just the right amount of everything.

Seemingly open late and a single table outside if you want to eat then and there.

Decided on the Salt Pepper Chicken Burrito ($10), which comes with some tortilla chips and hot sauces to the side. Tortilla wrap is crisped on the outside, stuffed with marinated chicken, sticky rice, beans, tomatoes, avocado, and pico de gallo. Interesting texture combination, as the rice sticks around the ingredients sushi-style. Chicken is seasoned well, and the side hot sauce adds the necessary kick. Also tried the Veggie Tacos ($8) as well - three to an order but not as flavorful as their meat counterparts.

Solid option when super hungry in the area. If no seating available, there are a couple bars nearby that allow food to be brought in.",2,0,0,2021-08-26,uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw,Philadelphia,FL,39.9338740361,-75.1583071211,1211 E Passyunck St,Positivo

DWVh69pl7bV3tBT0UV1stA,Central Taco & Tequila,"Tacos, Restaurants, Mexican, Nightlife, Cocktail Bars, Bars",4.0,"Central is a Mexican spot in Haddon Township (used to be the Irish Mile). I loved the vibe inside! It's dimly lit and there's cute lights around the bar area. You wouldn't know it's a Mexican place by the interior, but that's okay because I liked the simple, modern and classy feel to it. 

The menu is small and simple. It's mostly different types of tacos. The tacos are mix and match so each order comes with one taco for $3. The tacos are pretty small but they all come with a second tortilla so you can make two if you want. They also have salad, burrito and soup options. 

Here's what I ordered:

Drinks: Strawberry Pineapple margarita. 
Delicious but very strong! 

Appetizer: Chips with queso. 
The chips were not included. In my opinion, chips should always be included at a Mexican place so that was disappointing. The chips weren't as salty as I would've liked but the queso was pretty tasty. 

Entree: 3 tacos: Al Pastor, Spicy Crispy Chicken and Chicken Al Pastor.
Not the best tacos I've had but they were still good. I was able to make 2 tacos per order with the extra tortilla so I was definitely stuffed after my meal. I wish there was more meat in each taco.

Dessert: Churros with a chocolate dipping sauce and a cinnamon apple dipping sauce (this was their dessert special). 
Can't really complain about churros. Definitely order some if you're still hungry!

Overall, not the best Mexican food but the vibe and the margaritas made up for that. It's very reasonable priced and cheaper than going into the city to another upscale Mexican spot.

We found Mi Hacienda after checking out parks nearby with the kids. What a hidden gem! It's tucked away and easy to miss but nice and cozy when you walk in and has a nice little patio for the warmer months. 

My only knock on the place would be their salsa but I think that's a personal preference, as it always seems freshly prepared. I prefer more vegetables and cilantro. The chips and queso are always fantastic. 

It's always challenging to find a place that both of my kids will enjoy, along with my wife and I. Mi Hacienda has a pretty big kids menu. My daughter always sticks with a cheese quesadilla. My son alternates between the corn dog and the cheese burger. 

My wife and I have tried several dishes over our 10+ visits and have never been disappointed. Favorites include: seafood burrito, dos amigos combo, arroz con camarones, fajitas and hacienda quesadilla. 

The margaritas are just ok, typically just get an Arnold Palmer. The kids also really lIke the lemonade (not always the case with restaurant lemonade). When it's busy, the service can be a bit slow but the staff is always very friendly.

The shrimp were cooked fresh on the flat top while I waited which is a nice touch and the tacos were carefully constructed, but I was a bit disappointed in the portions.  Yes the shrimp are a decent size, but the toppings were more or less lacking for the $12 I shelled out.

CPBfpbD17lnRh0uovbAOTA,Taqueria Don Quezadillas Belinda,"Tours, Food Court, Mexican, Restaurants, Hotels & Travel, Food Tours",4.0,"For the love of all things food! This place has THE BEST birria tacos! 

So, I sorta developed a love for birria, and during my love phase, I found this place. First off, I'd been here once before, and had some delicious soup; that was over two years ago. So, when I was on a search for a local spot that sold the tacos and was within driving distance, I had to stop in. 

The day I was there, the owner said we had purchased the last bit of birria meat, which if I might add, is made with lamb meat she gets from Chicago. Unfortunately for me, another customer had ordered 3 - THREE, TRES pounds of the meat! I was outdone and instantly wanted to go to the person's home to invite myself over for more of the birria. 

The guacamole and chips are delish! The chips came out fresh and hot, and the guac was LOADED with amazing flavor.

Now as wonderful as the food was, there were a couple of small things I was not too happy about. I roughly pay no more than $3 (at $3 it's more of a supreme type taco) for an authentic taco almost any place I go. The price of the tacos here is $3.50-4. The other, the bigger issue I had, while looking at the menu to order some food to take home, the deep-fried quesadilla was listed on the menu for $6.99. The owner told me the price was now $9.99. Let's keep in mind that several price changes had already been made on the menu, as you could see the previous amounts had white-out on them, with the new amounts written in. Needless to say, the deep-fried quesadilla did not have a price change reflected on the menu. I am big on honoring what is listed, as the correct price for things. I just felt it was an upcharge due to convenience for whatever reasons possible. 

All of this considered I will go back for more birria tacos; I'll pay the $3.50 per taco.",1,0,0,2021-10-19,rRCYx1Rr5rBSy8_DXouSIQ,Indianapolis,MO,39.8256143,-86.126444,1920 E 38th St,Positivo

As you can guess I am eating out every single day. Here are some quick notes. This Taco Bell has been on point for a whole month, and taking care of me!

1. Service was top notch. Every single night they were pleasant! A breathe of fresh air based on other experiences in the area. 
2. My orders were correct EVERY single time. I am picky and ask for a lot of specific requests (that normally get mixed up here and there). 
3. Love they don't take my card. I place it in the credit card machine myself. 
4. Plenty of napkins (important when eating lunch in a car, or taking it back to the hotel). 
5. Love that they get the hot sauce situation completed during your order. And got the right sauce every single time 
6. Amazingly it looks like they are having a fun time at work during a really crappy time in the world today. Always smiling and joking with each other without it effecting their work/service level. 

Thank you for taking care of me for the past month. I appreciate EVERYTHING y'all are doing at this location. It made my day to day much easier, and I enjoyed my interaction. I am headed home in the morning, but felt I needed to post something. Hopefully y'all get to see this, and it shows the people really appreciate your work

Ok...by some reason of insanity there are no burrito shops in this area. Yes taco trucks, and Mexican restaurants,  but nowhere to pop by for a quick breakfast burrito (or lunch, or dinner,  or at all)...
So i found out taco bell has a breakfast menu. 
Craving a breakfast burrito of not- questionable  heritage,  i visited this location on a whim.
Had the (NOT) crunchy breakfast wrap, the cheesy (NOT) toasted breakfast burrito,  and the grande (over- toasted, possibly on fire when wrapped) breakfast burrito, and a Cinnabon bites.
The Cinnabon bites are SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS and better than anything dunkin d'oh nuts has on their menu.
The burnt flavored yet un- toasted grande burrito was ok, just over- burned obviously. 
The (TOTALLY NOT) toasted breakfast burrito was crunchy inside,  weirdly enough 
The breakfast (NOT)crunch wrap was actually the best overall even though it seemed to just be a soft taco wrap. Great cheesy goodness with just the right amount of egg and what taco bell calls ""sausage""...
So why 4 stars?
1) quick and passable for a craving 
2) incredibly nice friendly staff
3) not-so crunchwrap and
4) the AMAZING Cinnabon bites....

The service was excellent and the food was served up fast and fresh! I had a dinner called the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and it was fantastic! Their chips and salsa was on point and the salsa has just a bit of a kick but very tasty! They also have a jalapeño cream dip that's served along side of the regular salsa and chips and it's the best! I've never had it before but it's really really good and we were told all their dips and meals are made up fresh on site and the salsa dips can be purchased to take home. 
Their margaritas were very good as well. 

Chuy's is a great place to bring family or friends to hang out for a great meal. They have outdoor seating as well, and I'll be sure to take them up on that next season but until then, I'll be hitting this place on the regular. 

Conveniently located on Michigan Road in Carmel, you can do your shopping and then hit Chuy's before heading home. Also a word to the wise, the place gets crowed with people coming in around 4-4:30 for that dinner hour on Saturdays. Not a huge parking lot but additional space is available across the drive.

February 1, 2020: Had my second visit to Chuy's and it was better than the first. This time I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was out of this world! Great tasting and supremely fresh, which our waiter John said everything is made to order. Speaking of John, he's a slightly older guy with salt and pepper hair and light beard and this guy is off the chain. Great personality, witty, great jokes right off the top of his head and very attentive to his tables. We went out the door telling those waiting to be seated to ask for him as he's the best and they won't regret  it. 

Again I had the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom Enchiladas and couldn't  eat  it due to the large offering of my soul so i took it home, along with the 1/4 of the remaking soup I couldn't finish. Everything is so  good  tasting, the chips and salsa is the best!

I dont mind waiting for my food, If the person originally would give me heads up on time I wouldn't be that upset. She told me it is going to take 35-45 min to prepare my food, I told her I would give her an hour. She couldve mentioned they are understaffed and running late. She had plenty of time to do that, Instead she got really nasty w me when I called and asked if my food is ready she told me they are running late and it would take another 20 min. if I dont like to wait another 20 min which turned into 30 min btw I can cancel my order.

It wasn't too crowded but it looks nice and clean even though it is not a huge restaurant. Lots of nice tropical plants to make it feel like you're in tropical Mexico. On the door it says $CASH ONLY. Ok so I don't normally carry cash in my wallet but we went in anyway. The menu offers many vegetarian and a couple vegan options. Wow. I'm starting to like this place not because I'm one but maybe because they make healthier foods for a change. We ordered the Breakfast combination plate and the Huevos Poblano. After ordering I walked went across the street (thank God there was Wells Fargo) to try to get cash but it's still closed! Went back to the little one and then they served the food. Wow I'm impressed it seems so simple but it tasted pretty good. Salad for breakfast? I ate it with the special dressing provided on each table! The green Chile tamales is very good, slightly sweet, don't need dessert after that! The Chile rellenos is also very good and flavorful. It's also the little touches that make it different line the freshly cut pineapple with the skin still intact. I'm usually nauseated after eating out because restaurant food are usually greasy and fried; the chef at other restaurants usually uses tons of oil, but not this time! I feel great after eating, the portions are just right, didn't feel like I overate, even the beans are not refried with oily bacon grease. After eating, I had to make my trip out to wells Fargo again to get cash. I would give the little one a 4 star review for being inconvenient and making me go across the street for cash but I'm so impressed with the food and the overall atmosphere of the place that I'm going to award a 5 star! Will be back

The sopes were very good, we ordered bean sopes and received 4 sopes that were fried perfectly and very well seasoned. The nachos were big enough to make a meal from or share with a group of 4. Only wished they came in a half portion. However, the nachos came with a special sauce that was delicious and left me wanting for some more. The chimichanga was fried to a golden crisp and the chicken inside was very well seasoned and flavorful. However, the chimichanga came out a little sad, no cheese sauce or toppings on top. Not sure if this was a kitchen mistake but it left me wanting for more such as the cheese sauce, and pico de gallo or something to top it off. As for the veggie fajitas, they were very well seasoned and to my surprise, they come with flour tortillas that are made in-house.

So why should it get more than three stars?  Since we can't stay up to watch the Stupor Bowl, we figured we would have some sort of theme party dinner or something to that end.

So the Queen Bee made fresh guacamole with some lovely tortilla chips. I wound up getting a nice load of Messikin beer; so to round off our little SOTB I wound up getting this stuff. Not bad, I guess. I didn't wanna plunk down a ton of money for a big Messikin dinner either. So call me cheap!

Anyhoo: I got a taco/5 layer burrito crave box. That comes with 4 of each item, and one can customize it to the nth degree on the Taco Bell app. We don't care for crunchy tacos so I swapped those out for soft tacos supreme, fresco style. No ton of crappy cheese sauce or sour cream. 

I did the same thing with the burritos...fresco style, as well as grilled. So when I got there, the box of goodies was already sitting on the counter awaiting my arrival. As soon as I placed the order, I left in order to go get it. It's less than 5 minutes away from our house, and it wasn't busy at all.

Why do I say this?  Temperature of the stuff wasn't really great and box was already tepid (i.e. not warm) when I left. The speed of service was phenomenal (I guess that's why they call this junk ""fast food"").  The fellow behind counter was friendly enough too.  

All in all, it suited the purpose. Queen Bee got her Messikin fix for awhile. I got filled up cheap and there are leftovers for at least one or two more meals.

Chipotle on the other hand doesn't want to spend too much money to invest in the knowledge and future of their front line employees. Chipotle has to show off to their share holders how much Chipotle can ""persuade"" their employees to do their job with minimum remuneration package. All in the name of efficiency.
